Brainstorm:
	Fast paced shooter : (ref : Neon White, Ghostrunner)
	- Unreal 
	- Fast movements : Run, Crouch, Dash, Jump, (Hook, Wall run)
	- Speedrun : Timer -> gameover if fail
	- Enemies : Change difficulty with cursors (detection radius, bullet speed, attack speed...)
	- Weapon(s) : sword, gun, rocket...
	- Slow time ability
	- Traps, Jump pads, Speed boost
	- Level design : Shorter and harder alternative paths
	- Procedural (optional): based on time i can allow to the feature: enemies spawn (can be a difficulty cursor), environmental assets (trees...), complete procedural map (need to generate valid paths)
	- Music/Sounds


	What I need to work on: fluid/satisfying character movements, basic AI, procedural generation 





Checklist:

		- Dash

	- Weapons:
		- Gun

	- Enemies :
		- Detect player

Priority 2:
	- Satisfying and fast movements:
		- Hook
		- Wall run

		- End : fail when time runs out and win when reaching finish line
		- Slow time
		- Traps, jump pads, speed boost

	- Enemies :
		- Movements in neutral state

	- Weapons:
		- Rocket


Priority 3:
	- Procedural generation:
		- Do some research

	- Weapons:
		- Sword

	- Misc:
		- Music/Sounds
		- Difficulty : balancing, multiple difficulties

	- Enemies :
		- More complex movements in fight
